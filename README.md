# NeTEx Profile Documentation

A practical reference, learning resource, and example library for working with NeTEx.

This repository is a human-friendly entry point to NeTEx: a place to learn the structure of the standard, explore real examples, and understand how frames and objects relate to each other in practice.

- 📘 **Learn** the concepts and structure of NeTEx
- 🧭 **Navigate** frames, objects, and modeling patterns
- 🗂️ **Explore** a high-quality example library validated against the official XSD
- 🔎 **Reference** element ordering, cardinality, and profile-specific requirements

## 📚 How to Use This Repository

### Start here

| Step | Where | What you'll find |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | [`Guides/`](Guides/) | Conceptual overviews, conventions, and getting started material |
| 2 | [`Frames/`](Frames/) | How data is organized — each Frame groups related objects |
| 3 | [`Objects/`](Objects/) | Detailed reference for every NeTEx object with examples |

### Quick lookup

- 📋 [**Table of Contents**](LLM/Tables/TableOfContent.md) — Complete index of all Guides, Frames, and Objects
- 📄 [**Table of Examples**](LLM/Tables/TableOfExamples.md) — Every XML example with links and descriptions

---

## 🎯 What This Repository Contains

### 1. **Validated NeTEx examples**
Every XML example is:
- Validated against the [NeTEx 2.0 XSD schema](XSD%202.0/xsd/)
- Designed to illustrate a single concept or object clearly
- Available in multiple profiles (see [Profiles](#-profiles) below)
- Built using the standard NeTEx delivery pattern:

```xml
PublicationDelivery → dataObjects → Frame → …
```

### 2. **Structured documentation per object**
For every frame and object, you will find three files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Description_<Name>.md` | Purpose, structure overview, key elements, and relationships |
| `Table_<Name>.md` | Element-level specification with types, cardinality per profile, and XSD paths |
| `Example_<Name>_<Profile>.xml` | One or more validated XML examples |

### 3. **Guides**
Each guide lives in its own folder under [`Guides/`](Guides/) and can include supporting files (diagrams, XML snippets, etc.):

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [GetStarted](Guides/GetStarted/) | Minimal steps to begin working with the profile |
| [FramesOverview](Guides/FramesOverview/) | Purpose and relationships of the various Frames |
| [NeTExConventions](Guides/NeTExConventions/) | Casing rules, naming patterns, and a minimal example |
| [SeparationOfConcerns](Guides/SeparationOfConcerns/) | Responsibilities and boundaries between components |
| [Validation](Guides/Validation/) | How to validate NeTEx XML against schemas and rules |
| [InterchangeOnly](Guides/InterchangeOnly/) | Scope and constraints of the Interchange-only profile |
| [Glossary](Guides/Glossary/) | Terminology and definitions |

---

## 🏷️ Profiles

This repository documents three profiles, each representing a different level of detail:

| Profile | Code | Codespace | Description |
|---------|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Minimum** | `MIN` | `ERP` | Bare minimum elements required |
| **European Recommended** | `ERP` | `ERP` | Full European recommended profile |
| **Nordic** | `NP` | `NP` | Nordic-specific extensions and conventions |

Examples are named by profile: `Example_<Object>_MIN.xml`, `Example_<Object>_NP.xml`, etc.

### Codespace conventions

XML identifiers follow the pattern `<Codespace>:<ObjectType>:<Identifier>`:

```
ERP:DayType:WKD           ← European profile example
NP:ServiceJourney:15044   ← Nordic profile example
NSR:StopPlace:59977       ← Norwegian StopPlace Registry (stop infrastructure)
```

> `NSR` is reserved for stop infrastructure data (StopPlace, Quay, TopographicPlace) in Nordic Profile examples.

The `ParticipantRef` in all examples uses `EuPro` to identify this as European Profile documentation.

## 🧱 Conventions

### File naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| XML examples | `Example_<Name>_<Profile>.xml` | `Example_Line_MIN.xml` |
| Descriptions | `Description_<Name>.md` | `Description_Line.md` |
| Tables | `Table_<Name>.md` | `Table_Line.md` |

### XML structure principles

- Collections use `lowerCamelCase` (`dataObjects`, `vehicleJourneys`, `pointsInSequence`)
- Type elements use `UpperCamelCase` (`ServiceJourney`, `StopPlace`)
- `*Ref` elements express relationships between objects
- Element order must match the NeTEx XSD sequence (inherited elements first)
- Time values use timezone-aware `xs:dateTime` → `2026-02-25T14:22:00Z`
- All examples are validated against `XSD 2.0/xsd/NeTEx_publication.xsd`

---

## ✅ Validation

All XML examples in this repository are validated against the official NeTEx XSD schema, both locally and in CI.

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Local (bash)** | `./scripts/validate-xml.sh` |
| **Local (changed only)** | `./scripts/validate-xml.sh --changed` |
| **CI (pull request)** | Automatic via `PR_Validator.yml` |
| **CI (push)** | Automatic via `Commit_Validator.yml` on `EnStandardBranch` |

See the [Validation guide](Guides/Validation/) for detailed instructions.
